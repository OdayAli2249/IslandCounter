## Description
IslandCounter is a C++ project that implements an algorithm to count the number of islands in a given 2D array. In this context, an island is defined as a group of connected wild cells. The 2D array consists of two types of characters: one representing wild cells and the other representing sea cells. The algorithm scans the array and counts how many distinct islands are present.
